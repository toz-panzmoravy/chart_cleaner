This custom MT5 indicator adds a dynamic "Cleaner" button directly into the chart area. The button allows traders to instantly clean up the chart by removing all graphical objects except the most recent N candles (configurable).

🔧 Features
📌 Fixed button position: Always visible in the top-right corner of the chart area, regardless of scrolling or resizing.

🧹 One-click cleanup: Deletes all objects older than the last CandlesToKeep bars.

🛡️ Safe for system elements: The cleaner does not delete itself or interfere with the button object.

🔄 Responsive design: Automatically adapts button position when the chart is resized.
